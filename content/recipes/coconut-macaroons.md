## Ingredients

* 3 cups sweetened, shredded coconut
* 4 large egg whites
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla or almond extract
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F

2. For deeper coconut flavor and extra-crispy macaroons, spread the coconut on the baking sheet and toast for about 5 minutes, or until just barely starting to show some color.
Let cool slightly before using.

3. Combine the egg whites, sugar, vanilla, and salt in a mixing bowl. Whisk until the whites and sugar are completely combined and the mixture is frothy.

4. Pour the coconut over the egg white mixture and stir until the coconut is evenly moistened.

5. Line the baking sheet with parchment. With wet hands to prevent sticking, shape the coconut mixture into small balls about 1 ½-inches in diameter.
Space them an inch or so apart on the baking sheet.

6. Bake the macaroons until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.

7. Let the macaroons cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Macaroons can be kept in an airtight container for up to a week.

## Tips

For a nice combination, add blackberry jelly. Before baking, make indentation in the tops with your thumb and put in a small amount of jelly.
